Small project that uses playwright to open random Wikipedia article and then clicks the first link in the artcile until it gets to the Philosophy page. 
If you want to try it, you will need to run 'pwsh bin/Debug/net8.0/playwright.ps1 install' (to install playwright browsers) then you can use 'dotnet test' to run it.
